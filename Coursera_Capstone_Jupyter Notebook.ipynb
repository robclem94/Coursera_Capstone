Another widely held perception is that there are more young and \"hippster\" people will follow a vegan diet. To test these two assumptions I would like to compare the amount vegan restaurants per capita in Berlin to that in Munich which in contrast is known to be more traditional espcially it's hearty and meaty traditional German cuisine.\n\nThe problem may sound trivial, however it is hugley import to understand the demographics of cities in order to understand its people, needs and problems. The results of the research could be helpful to government, town planners, businesses and residents.

There are a couple of types of data we can to attepte to answer the question above. \n\n1) As mentioned above I would like to establish frequancy of types of restaurants (vegan and traditional) in both cities. This will alow calcualtion of restaurants per capita in both cities. Such data will be gathered through geospatial data (longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates) in the foursquare database which can map places of note on maps including venues such as restaurants and cafes, museums and shops.\n\n2) A key point of interest for this research in the foursquare API data is restaurant reviews. By comparing the reviews and and ratings of both vegan and tradtional german restaurants in both cities we may be able to establish a degree of which cuisine is more popular and potentially a idea of the residents of Berlin and Munich.
