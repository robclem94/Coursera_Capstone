Another widely held perception is that there are more young and \"hippster\" people will follow a vegan diet. To test these two assumptions I would like to compare the amount vegan restaurants per capita in Berlin to that in Munich which in contrast is known to be more traditional espcially it's hearty and meaty traditional German cuisine."

There are a couple of types of data we can to attepte to answer the question above. \n\n1) As mentioned above I would like to establish frequancy of types of restaurants (vegan and traditional) in both cities. This will alow calcualtion of restaurants per capita in both cities. \n\n2) Another intersting data point provided through the Foursquare API is person reviews. By comparing the reviews and and ratings of both vegan and tradtional german restaurants in both cities we may be able to establish a degree of which cuisine is more popular and potentially a idea of the residents of Berlin and Mucnich.
