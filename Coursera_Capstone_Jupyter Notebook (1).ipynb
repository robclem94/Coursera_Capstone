On such changes is a percived genrtrification of part of the city which have gained a reputation for being a more bohemian, young and \"hippster\". Another widely held perception is that within this demopgraphic of young and \"hippster\" type people is that veganism and alternative diets are popular. This project aims to test these assumptions and gather the most vegan friendly areas of Berlin using available data. "}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Problem\nThe problem may sound trivial, however it is hugley import to understand the demographics of cities in order to understand it's people, needs and problems. This is escpcially true in Berlin that has seen vast changes since the reunification of Germany in the early 1990s which created much change in berlin including a influx of new arrivals or the re-settlement of people into the urban centers which inturn has lead to the displacement of others due to inflating rent prices. Such phenomena has been phrased as gentrification (1) and has put ressures on local government who try to balance urban rewnewal whilst limiting the negative effects (2). \n\n1) Zerofsky (2019) - https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-causes-and-consequences-of-berlins-rapid-gentrification\n\n2) Levine (2004) - http://rohcavamaintenant.free.fr/USB%20KEY%20Fahriye/GENTRIFICATION/Government%20Policy-The%20Local%20State-and%20Gentrification.pdf"}, {"metadata": {}, "cell_type": "markdown", "source": "### Interest\nThe results of the research could provide helpful for government, town planners, businesses and residents as a guide to more tradtional areas with more gentrified and younger areas of the city.

There are a few important data points we can use to attempt to answer the question above. \n\n1) As mentioned above  would like to establish frequancy of types of restaurants (vegan and other) in the Berlin boroughs. This will alow calcualtion of restaurants per capita. Such data will be gathered through geospatial data (longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates) which can be used in the  in foursquare database which can map places of note on maps including venues such as restaurants and cafes, museums and shops.\n\n2) Another key point of interest for this research in the foursquare API data is restaurant reviews. By comparing the reviews and and ratings of both vegan and other restaurants in the city we may be able to establish the degree of populararity of restaurants potentially giving us a idea of tastes the residents of Berlin.\n\n3) Demographic data including population and ethnicity of the boroughs will allow us to compare and contrast restaurant data. This data will be sourced by webscrapping wikipedia. It is also this table that will give us a defintive list of the berlin bourghs which can be used to search the centre coordinates of each boroughs.
